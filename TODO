* Comparison: detect adding/deleting pods, not only containers
* Bug: in reference container, PVCs are not filled. Can be seen during comparison.
* Double-check comparison especially with multiple input files
* Add context variable where relevant
* Tree mode must respect 'with_changes'
* For filter - make "does NOT match regex"
* For per-container parsing: make configurable (may be) or simplify
* Toggle Megabytes | Mibibytes units
* Deleted Pod use case
* Make generic mechanism of parsing resources: CPU, memory, ephemeral-storage, storage
* Resource management: if requests/limits are not specified, set some flag when calculating totals (calculation is not precise)
